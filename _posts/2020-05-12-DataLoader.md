# What is dataloader
- library for batchin and caching
- these two techniques that we use to make if fast to execute against database back-end behind web service

# When to use DataLoader and Redis
- DataLoader
  - cache is specific to an individual request.
  - if two requests are processed at the same time, they will not share a cache. 
  - it does not have an expiration and a mechanism for invalidating individual cache values.
  - cache will be deleted once the request completes

- Redis
  - key-value store that's used for caching, queues, PubSub and more
  - it use the cached value until it expires or is invalidated
  - using it as a cache layer between GraphQL and the database, API or other data source
  - using it as part of a PubSub implementation when implementing subscriptions

# summary
- DataLoader caching does not replace Redis, Memcache, or any other shared application-level cache.
- DataLoader is first and foremost a data loading mechanism, and its cache only serves the purpose of not repeatedly loading the same data in the context of a single request to your Application.
