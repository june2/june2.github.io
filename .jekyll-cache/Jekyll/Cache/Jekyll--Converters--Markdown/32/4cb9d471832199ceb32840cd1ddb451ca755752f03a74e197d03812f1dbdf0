  <li>NodeJS middleware are routines that have access to the Request object (req) and Response object (res).</li>
  <li>These routines are called before route handlers, so they live in the â€œmiddleâ€ between the client the response-generating route logic.</li>
  <li>A NodeJS application can â€œchainâ€ middleware routines into a custom request/response pipeline. - The pipeline can act on the request and response, including the headers and body.</li>
