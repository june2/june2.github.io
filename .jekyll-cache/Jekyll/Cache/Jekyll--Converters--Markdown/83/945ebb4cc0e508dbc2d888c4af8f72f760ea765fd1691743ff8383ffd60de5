<p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a “JavaScript everywhere” paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts.</p>
